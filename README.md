# hello_world
The beginnings of a hopeful Computer tech passion
Currently trying to audit the Harvard CS50 course on edx
At the present I want to understand Networking portocol a bit more so I know what im reading about tinc and hosaka corp
These past two days I havent done much, but its been the most productive Ive been in a long time and that makes me really happy
